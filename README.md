## Altoros Dapp Test

### Goal

Create a DApp that allows people to vote on a (binary) proposal. Each ethereum address should be allowed to vote only once and the vote should cost 0.01 ETH.

When a user opens the page, it should see the result so far (number of positive votes vs. number of negative votes). Real-time updating is a bonus, but not required.

The app should consist only of a frontend. It should work in Rinkeby and with MetaMask.

The contract is already deployed at `0x9b7ae666ec5d51c793379612344fac224f29f733`. You can see it [here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9b7ae666ec5d51c793379612344fac224f29f733#code).

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions you may have.

### Stack and tools required

The only requirements are to use React for the frontend. Everything else is up to you. We recommend using [web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react), but it's not required.

You can get Rinkeby ether [here](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Alternatively, in MetaMask import the address `0xc5Ab57Cb50a7e8eECE4190bf95df3014a7589531` with private key `0x0fff86e3cff17fc341c5e3104459807a1133bcf32b8f9e9d3184ec01f8df85a6` which already has 3 ETH loaded.
