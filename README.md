## Altoros Dapp Test - Alternative version

This version of the application has an alternative contract without the restrictions that each account can vote once.

This version has the same technical characteristics as the version of the master branch.
Running and deployment are the same, too.

The contract is already migrated, you need to deploy it in a local o external environment and copy the address in the _contractAddress.js_ file.
